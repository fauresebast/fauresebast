# [Fauresebast](https://github.com/fauresebast)
Softare Engineer from EPITA graduated in 2019 (Data Science and AI major, called SCIA).

## My profile
I started as a DataScientist intern for my end-of-studies internship but I chose to focus more on programming itself as a Software Engineer.
I feel really comfortable with Python and I am currently working with Ruby on Rails. You can find more information on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fauresebast/).

I also like competitive programming and I am still working on improving. I mainly compete on [CodingGame](https://www.codingame.com/profile/3d63099f61c408eaeac7be86dc3669be7382352) and more precisely in [Clash of Codes](https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/clashofcode) which are short challenges to solve in less than 15 minutes. My peak rank is 65 on September 9th 2020 (187 348 CodinGamers on the leaderboard at this point).

## My github
My github gathers home hobby projects. From little web application to little project to discover new technologies such as Go.
